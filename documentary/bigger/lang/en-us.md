# How the Universe is Way Bigger Than You Think

Think about this for a second; it takes us around three days to reach the Moon, approximately seven months to get the closest planet to us, namely Mars, 15 months to reach Venus, six years to reach Jupiter, seven to reach Saturn, 8.5 years to reach Uranus, 9.5 years to reach Pluto - the closest dwarf planet, and twelve years to get to Neptune, the farthest planet.

The Sun is 0.00001581 light-years away, and in the best-case scenario, we could reach it in 25 days. So how big is the Universe? Its around 93 billion light-years.

The observable Universe is 93 billion light-years in diameter. Some scientists believe its true size is even scarier than that. By using the Bayesian model averaging, scientists estimated that the Universe is at least 250 times larger than the observable Universe, or at least 7 trillion light-years in diameter.
