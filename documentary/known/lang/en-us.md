# The Known Universe by American Museum of Natural History

Travel through the Milky Way galaxy and beyond as you #LearnWithMe! Join a guided flight through the universe with the Museum's director of astrovisualization Carter Emmart. Emmart uses the new interactive data visualization software OpenSpace to take you to the outer reaches of the Known Universe and takes viewer questions.

The Known Universe takes viewers through our atmosphere and the inky black of space to the afterglow of the Big Bang. Every star, planet, and quasar seen in the film is possible because of the world's most complete four-dimensional map of the universe.

OpenSpace is a open source interactive data visualization software designed to visualize the entire known universe and portray our ongoing efforts to investigate the cosmos.

Funded in part by NASA, OpenSpace brings the latest techniques from data visualization research to the general public. OpenSpace supports interactive presentation of dynamic data from observations, simulations, and space mission planning and operations.
