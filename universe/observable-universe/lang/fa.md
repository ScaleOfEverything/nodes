# Observable Universe

The radius, which is half of the diameter, is about 46 billion light-years. You
might expect to only see 13.7 billion light-years away because light has had
only 13.7 billion years to travel, but due to the expansion of space, the
objects that used to be 13.7 billion light-years away are now 46 billion
light-years away, and we can see these.
