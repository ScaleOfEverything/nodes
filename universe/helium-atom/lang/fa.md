# Helium Atom

Hydrogen atoms are larger than Helium atoms because more protons in an atom's
nucleus pull the electrons in closer. However, additional shells increase the
size of the atoms the most. Cesium, the largest atom, has the most shells with
the fewest electrons. (Francium has not been measured.)
