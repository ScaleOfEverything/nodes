# Chlorine Nucleus

A chlorine nucleus has 17 protons and anywhere from 11 to 34 neutrons. However,
the majority of these isotopes will decay within minutes, if not seconds! The
only stable isotopoes are chlorine-35 (18 neutrons) and chlorine-37 (20
neutrons). Even numbers of neutrons (especially magic numbers 2, 8, 20, 28, 50,
82, and 126) tend to be more stable than odd ones.
